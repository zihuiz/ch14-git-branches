In this exercise, you'll practice working with branches, including **merging** changes between them.

For this exercise, complete the following steps:

1. Clone _this_ module repository.

2. Open up _this_ `README.md` file in Atom. Be sure to open the one in the `exercise-1` folder!

3. Create and `checkout` a new branch called `experiment`

4. Add a sentence at the bottom of the `README.md` file. What you had for breakfast is fine. Remember to save your changes to disk!

5. Commit your change (hint: use `git commit -am "msg"` to add and commit at once!)

6. `checkout` the `master` branch. You shuld see your previous sentence disappear!

7. Add yet another sentence **at the top of the file** --- for example, a title or subtitle.

8. Commit your change

9. Switch between the experiment and master branches (clicking on your editor in-between). Do you see the file contents changing? Note: In some editors you may need to close and re-open the file to see the changes.

10. Now `merge` the contents from `experiment` ___into___ `master`. Remember you'll want to switch to the `master` branch first (the one you are merging ___into___).
